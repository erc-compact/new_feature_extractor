How to use:

Update json file based on required features
Use parallel_Launch_features.sh to extract the features from all the files in a directory or use FITS_generator directly.py for .ar files and FITS_generator_for_pfd.py for pfd files

This work runs PulsarX (https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02544) for .ar files and PRESTO (https://github.com/scottransom/presto) for .pfd files under the hood.
